// A bare `zig build` uses whichever `zig` is first on PATH, and on a machine that has an older Zig there
// that is a toolchain `build.zig` refuses on purpose. Resolving the compiler through `check-zig.mjs` means
// `bun run build` and the test suite agree about which Zig is being used, and the failure names the fix
// instead of burying a version mismatch in the build output. `ZIG` still overrides, exactly as it does for
// `bun check-zig.mjs`.
